There are several different ways to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line) feel free to use any or play with each of them:
float/clear
inline-block
flexbox
CSS Grid
Be careful with borders and margins, they can adjust the size of the squares!

Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
Hint: “hovering” is what happens when your mouse enters a div and ends when your mouse leaves it.. you can set up event listeners for either of those events as a starting point.
There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including:
adding a new class to the div
changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.

(Optional): Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example) have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
